									This was a summer research project where I worked with a colleague and a professor to create databases for use in teaching a course. The goal was to discover datasets on the internet that were real rather than toy examples that were previously used and use them in databases. This involved many aspects of database management. We found data, designed a database, and made programs to import the data.	
								</p>
								<p>
									Personally, I created three databases for the project. These databases involved video game sales and ratings, American national parks biodiversity, and selected country statistics. This was a great project for me, and it taught me useful skills such as how to work with others, communicate ideas better, and even how to work at my first job.
