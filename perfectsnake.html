								<p>
									This project, Perfect Snake, is my senior capstone project at Westminster College. The goal was to make a snake algorithm that could play the game Snake perfectly. For those who are not already acquainted with Snake, the game involves playing as a snake on a grid and you must collect apples to increase your score and increase in size by one for each apple eaten. The goal is to get as many points as possible without dying which would involve hitting the body or the self.								</p>
								<p>
									Playing the game perfectly means playing the game and eating apples until the snake covers the entire grid with its own body. The agent was made through three different algorithms with their individual strengths and weaknesses. These algorithms were Deep Q-Learning, A* Pathfinding, and Hamiltonian circuit. The game was only perfectly beaten through a Hamiltonian circuit, but using this method, the game was beaten perfectly every time. The Hamiltonian circuit also uses a path-skipping method where the path is skipped at certain points if the position between the head of the snake and the food is too large.								<p>
								<p>
									Making the algorithms required me to understand much about how the computer works at the lower end, primarily because there were times when the snake would take too long to load so I had to figure out more efficient methods to run the program otherwise it simply would not work. I was also required to understand how object-oriented programming worked as I had several classes and functions where everything was organized. I also had significant experience working with my professors and alone on this project to ensure everything was working well and I had to communicate better to ensure everything was going to plan. Finally, I had to understand how to solve problems and critically think about them by thinking about how to beat the game with different methods. Overall, I hope this is a showcase of my ability to program, think about code and problems, and be creative.
