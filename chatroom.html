									This program is a collaborative project in a networks course with one other person with the goal of creating a chatroom for people to communicate on a network. This enables users to start up a server, connect using multiple clients, send messages to one another, and finally disconnect when done. This is a very simple program and is only used for demonstration purposes.
								</p>
								<p>
									We worked on designing the network and setting up the protocols for connection and communication, then we programmed the chatroom in Java and we learned quite a bit about how networks work. We also learned a lot about collaboration with others and about socket programming. We would have loved to add encryption to the system, however, due to time constraints we could not. Due to the lack of encryption, we recommend you do not use this for personal or business use! Instructions for running the program are provided in the readme on the GitHub page.
