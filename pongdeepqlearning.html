									This is a project for playing the video game pong with deep q learning. The game pong is one of the first video games ever made and is very simple yet hard to master. It involves moving a paddle on either side and hitting a ball to the enemy side to get points when the enemy fails to hit the ball. Due to this game's simplicity, it is an ideal game to train using a Deep Q-Learning network. We trained it using OpenAI's Gym and it was able to get decent scores against a chaser AI which simply moves up or down to try to get the middle position of the paddle to be near the ball.

									I had to work with a partner on this project and we had to learn how to coordinate which hyperparameters we were going to use to ensure that we get this project right. We also learned about critical thinking skills because although some would consider deciding the correct parameters for a neural network an art, there is quite a lot of science that goes into choosing the correct parameters. I also learned how to program a correct reward function based on what logically makes sense for a network such as this.
