								<p>Team Software is a collaborative semester-long project in a software engineering class with the goal of teaching math to those in early elementary school. Personally, I worked on the gameplay mechanics while the other two teammates in the group worked on setting up the database and its connections and the graphical user interface. The game was made in the Unity game engine as it was at that time the industry standard for video game development.</p>
								<p>I already knew much about how the Unity game engine and C# worked as I had programmed in the engine in my spare time. I did not know about databases in Unity and so I had to learn about how to connect a database with Unity and how to collaborate with others. I had to design the gameplay and while it was simple it was very interesting, and I could see this game being used to teach math in schools. Initially I had trouble understanding how to work with others due to never working in a group like this before, but in the end, I believe I learned much about soft skills and working with a team.</p>
